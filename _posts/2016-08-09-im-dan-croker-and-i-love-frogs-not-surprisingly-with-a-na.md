![One of my Bathroom Sudoku series covers.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a3ea15cb-7131-45b5-b07b-32236c488136.jpg)

I'm Dan Croker and I love frogs! Not surprisingly, with a name like Croker.

I also love Sudoku. So when I began creating my own Sudoku books, I just had to include my beloved frogs somehow. And so Famous Frog Sudoku was born.

Now I know that Sudoku is a very serious hobby but I wanted to lighten things up a bit and put some fun into my books. The only way to do that is with some seriously silly covers!
